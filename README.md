# Simulation of STM32 Based Embedded Systems

## AIM:
To draw the schematic and simulate the embedded system for the given requirement.

## REQUIREMENT:

## STEPS:

## step 1: We start by designing the circuit in Proteus.
## step 2: 3 switches, 1 push button and a pair of LEDs are used for each.
## step 3: The necessary connections are made out to complete the flow from Inputs (switch) to the Outputs (LEDs).
## step 4: Once the entire layout has been designed, we move to coding the Microcontroller. 
## step 5: In STM32CubeIDE we configure the necessary pins as GPIO Input and Output pins.
## step 6: Then we use a logical counter to blink the LEDs according to their respective frequencies.
## step 7: After coding all the ports, we build the project and load the .elf file onto the simulator.
